        <h3>I love you too baby🤭❤</h3>
        <h3>You mean the world to me, I've never love someone this much in my entire life🥰</h3>
        <h3>You're a wonderful person, I wish I could be a better boyfriend and make you smile more often😔</h3>
        <h3>I'm really sorry baby, I love you so much, I want to hug and kiss you, I want to be with you every second😫</h3> 
        <h3>I promise to be a better boyfriend, I was so selfish these past few days, I'm really really sorry</h3>
	<h3>I was so scared to lose you that I started overthinking and suffocate you. Please forgive me😔</h3>
	<h3>I wish everything was fine between us, it's so hard babe😔</h3>
	<h3>I'm not going to give up, not after that I met the ONE, not after that I met my Soulmate</h3>
        <h3>I love you so so much, there's no woman on this planet that is better than you🥰</h3>
	<h3>I really hope that it's going to work out babe, I don't want to lose you</h3>
	<h3>I'm crying just thinking about it, you're so important to me</h3>
	<h3>I'm going to make you my wife one day, I promise</h3>
	<h3>And babe please tell me when something is annoying you</h3>
	<h3>I want to help you babe, I want to be here for you</h3>
	<h3>We're so far from each other, we need to communicate</h3>
	<h3>If you don't tell me how am I going to help you</h3>
	<h3>I don't like seeing you like that babe</h3>
	<h3>It's so painful seeing the one you love like that</h3>
        <h3>Sorry again for everything. I LOVE YOU!!❤❤</h3>
