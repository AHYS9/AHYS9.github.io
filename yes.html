        <h2>I love you too baby, you mean the world to me, I've never love someone this much in my entire life, you're a wonderful person, I wish I could be a better boyfriend and make 
        you smile more often. I'm really sorry baby, I love you so much, I want to hug and kiss you, I want to be with you every second. I promise to be a better boyfriend, I was
        so selfish these past few days, I'm really really sorry, I was so scared to lose you that I started overthinking and suffocate you. Please forgive. I love you so so much, 
        compared to me you're so perfect, there's no woman on this planet that is better than you. I hope you're having a great day, see you soon baby. I LOVE YOU!!</h2>
